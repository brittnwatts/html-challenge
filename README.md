# html-challenge

This ReadMe serves to:
   1. Certify that this work is my own,
   2. Specify code source and its location in my 'html-challenge' repository,
   3. Clarify the reason for the assignment,

1. 

My name is Brittney Watts, and I am in the UNCC/EdX Data Analytics Bootcamp. Currently, we 
are working on Module 9 of our exploration into BeautifulSoup, HTML, and Splinter.



2. 

The source code is my interpretation of the information we have learned in class with some debugging help from forums, and here
is a breakdown of the locations of each element of my assignment:

   html-challenge
      mars_facts
          part_1_mars_news.ipynb
          part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
      Resources

          weather_data.csv
      README.md

This assignment serves to track my understanding of HTML, Web Scraping, BeautifulSoup.

Mars Facts(2 deliverables):

   This challenged me to extract data from websites and perform different tasks like organizing, storing, analyzing, and visually communicating the data. 
   The first website for deliverable 1 was a website with a list of articles. The second website for deliverable 2 contained a table with data like temperature, months, and atmospheric pressure.
   
   My Steps:
       
       Deliverable 1:

          - Create the BeautifulSoup object and extract elements from the website (article titles and previews)
      

          - Store each title and preview pair in a python dictionary with corresponding keys and print it into the notebook.


          - Store all of this data into a JSON File!
          
          
          
       Deliverable 2:


          - create a BeautifulSoup object and use it to scrape the data from the HTMl table.
          

          - Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with the same headings.


          - Convert the data types from the table if necessary.


          - Analyse the dataset and answer the following questions:
              1. How many months exist on mars?
              2. How many martial days worth of data are in the dataset
              3. What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars?
              4. Which months are the hottest and coldest on Mars?
              5. Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure?
              How many terrestrial days exist in a single martian year?


          - Export the data to a csv file!


THANK YOU!!!!!
